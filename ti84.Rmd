# __Ti-84 Graphing Calculator Programming__
<p>The Ti-84 graphing calculators have the ability to create your own programs
to show the sequences and radians, compute the quadratic formula, and more!</p>
<p>In tenth grade, I grew tired of having to memorize math formulas, so in my calculator 
I first started out with having them displayed when running a created program. 
This obviously gave me an upper hand on tests and the math teacher approved of 
this as it was impressive to use a calculator with this type of reasoning.</p>
<p>Becoming more interested in coding on calculators I began programming tiny programs 
turning what was only being displayed into real-time calculations. 
The programming language is called, _TI-Basics_</p>
<p>I have not resorted to using my programs anymore, but calculator programs were 
legal on the ACT exams! The only rule that applied was the programs could only have 
10 lines of code, however it need said how many programs you could have...</p>
